# ExploitWriteUps
Practice in buffer overflows, stack, and heap exploits - along with ASLR, DEP, ROP, and Canaries mitigation.

## Tools

I will be automating the actual exploitation with Python and pwntools(?) for getting hands on proof of concepts down. Radare2 and GDB for reverse engineering/exploring stack.
