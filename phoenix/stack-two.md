# Stack buffer overflow environment variables

This exercise intends to an environmental variable getenv("ExploitEducation") for our program value, and have it do the same memory corruption as the previous exercises.

Again, having a char[64] buffer array, a volatile int, and then strcpy() later with the buffer overriding our int.

Using:
export ExploitEducation=$'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\t\n\r'
It was equal to the value necessary for 0x0d0a090a
