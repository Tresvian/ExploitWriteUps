# Stack buffer overflow manipulation

Next exercise was similar to stack-zero, but this one had an objective of changing the volatile value into a specific one.

That being: int=0x496c5962

Here, instead of gets(), argv[1] is passed into char64[], so we can pass 64chars and 4 more chars with the string "bYlI"

The full command: ./stack-one AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAbYlI

Successfully changing the variable into our desired value.
